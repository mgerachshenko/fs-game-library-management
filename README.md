## Project Description

This project aims to simulate the core experience of the Steam client. Users
can view the games they own, manage their downloads and manage their personal
account information.

### General User Stories

1. **Dara**, As a gamer, I want to manage personal information, like my user
   name, profile picture etc.
2. **Lance**, As a gamer, I want to be able to manage my downloads, so that I
   can uninstall the games I'm not playing.
3. **Mikhail**, As a gamer, I want to be able to have a wishlist of games and
   be able to buy games with ease while seeing if they have a discount on them.
